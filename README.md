Alphabet Pyramid
================

The Challenge
-------------
Write a program which draws a diamond of the form illustrated below. The letter which is to appear at the widest point of the figure (E in the example) is to be specified as input data (CLI arg, keyboard read-in, etc).

                      A

                     B B

                    C   C

                   D     D

                  E       E

                   D     D

                    C   C

                     B B

                      A

Inputs are [a-zA-Z] (e.g. letters only, upper or lower case). Output is upper case only.

Edge cases:
If you input "a" or "A", then the output is simply "A".
If the input is invalid, then the output is "INVALID INPUT". If you read from keyboard input you may ask the user for a new input.

The Criteria
------------
The winner will be decided by the judges, but you might want to think about...
* including a GO script to run it
* execution time
* human readability
* elegance of the solution
